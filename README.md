# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
V.Isualize has given me a and Omar a new project to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. After creating these DataFrames, I created a multiple-line graph that shows the weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
The results were divided into three different city types. They were rural, suburban, and urban. The image below includes data for each city type: the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

## Summary
From my analysis, we could see that urban had the highest total fare. Next was suburban, and rural had the lowest total fare. We could see that there was not much change over the time with the results. I would recommend rural if the CEO is looking for the cheapest location.
